Overview:

Source code audit tool based on ncurses library. Using naudit you can search for lines of text matching specific patterns and tag/review those matching lines.

Dependencies:

 - libcdk5 (ncurses widget library)
 - libncurses5 (ncurses library)
 - autotools (GNU autotools)

Install:

 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Basic usage example:

Let's say you want to audit all calls to strcpy and memcpy in the Linux kernel, run naudit this way:

 $ naudit -s mySessionName -r strcpy -r memcpy /usr/src/linux

Now you can navigate through lines of code using arrow keys, inspect a line with your editor by pressing
enter, cycle through the different result sets with TAB key, choose the apropriate tag for a line using
space key. Press q to quit naudit

Then if you need to resume auditing at a later time, you can run naudit like this:

 $ naudit -s mySessionName
