Overview:

Source code audit tool based on ncurses library. Using naudit you can search for lines of text matching specific patterns and tag/review those matching lines.

Dependencies:

 - libcdk5 (ncurses widget library) (sudo apt-get install libcdk5 libcdk5-dev)

Install:

 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Also you have shell completion scripts available for bash or zsh in ./shell folder.

Usage:
	./naudit <options> [path...]

		-h, --help                   	Print this help and exit
		-v, --version                	Print naudit version and exit
		-b, --batch                  	Batch mode
		-c, --config <folder>        	Use <folder> as config folder
		-e, --ext <list>             	List of file extensions to search for
		-E, --ext-file <file>        	Use <file> to get a list of extensions to search for, one extension per line
		-i, --ignore-ext <list>      	List of file extensions to ignore
		-I, --ignore-ext-file <file> 	Use <file> to get a list of file extensions to ignore, one extension per line
		-p, --path <list>            	List of path to search for files to audit
		-P, --path-file <file>       	Use <file> to get a list of path to search for files to audit, one path per line
		-r, --regex [label:]<regex>  	Use <regex> as a pattern to match lines of code and store them in a file called label in the current session
		-R, --regex-file <file>      	Use <file> to get a list of regex to match lines of code to audit, one [label:]<regex> per line. See --regex
		-s, --session <session>      	Session name to work on. Creates a new session if required
		-t, --tag <list>             	List of tags for the current session
		-T, --tag-file <file>        	Use <file> to get a list of tags for the current session, one tag per line

Examples:

Let's say you want to audit all calls to strcpy and memcpy in the Linux kernel, run naudit this way:

 $ naudit -s mySessionName -e c,h -r strcpy -r memcpy /usr/src/linux

Now you can navigate through lines of code using arrow keys, inspect a line with your editor by pressing enter, cycle through the different result sets with TAB key, choose the apropriate tag for a line using space key. Press q to quit naudit.

Then if you need to resume auditing at a later time, you can run naudit like this:

 $ naudit -s mySessionName
