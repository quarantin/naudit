metadata for a session (regex, path, exts)
templating for each language/session
add option to specify what part of the path should not be displayed to avoid too long lines
add option to choose gnu/posix regex
add interactive search feature
custom tags in session seem to not be taken into account
detect extension/filetype to choose appropriate editor (for example hexedit for binary data, vim for source code files etc)
print number of match per map file in gui
try to manage syntax highlighing/colors
allow to modify a project (for exemple add regex) and being able to keep status for lines of code that have already been audited
add option to match regex in binary data
plug in sql subsystem to store sessions instead of storing them in flat files (sqlite, mysql, pgsql, oracle). Also would allow for cooperative auditing. Makes me wonder if a web interface would be useful.
run text editors with options to higlight current regex
parse configuration file
add configuration option to specify default extension list
add option to ignore some path (like .svn, .cvs etc)
add verbose mode to see all the files which are searched
implement update/merge map file
add command line switch to hide some line depending on their status
